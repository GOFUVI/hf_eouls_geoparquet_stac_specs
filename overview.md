## Overview

HF-Radars are coastal radar systems designed to measure surface currents over wide swaths of ocean. The raw output of these systems are the **Doppler spectra** captured at each antenna. In CODAR's SeaSonde Hf-Radars, **Radial Metrics**—derived by applying the MUSIC algorithm to those Doppler spectra—serve as an intermediate product between the raw spectral data and the final, gridded surface-current maps generated by SeaSonde systems. Each Radial Metric records every individual return echo detected by the radar: its bearing and range relative to the radar site, the received signal strength, and other metadata.

Whether produced in real time by CODAR’s native software or post-processed later with tools like **SeaSondeR** (an R package) [1](#ref1), Radial Metrics have proven valuable for applications beyond current estimation—such as wave-field analysis and wind-speed inversion. Because they capture individual echoes, however, data volumes grow very rapidly: even when restricted to only those spectral bands containing current information, a half-hour sampling interval can yield over one million echoes in under a week.

By default, both CODAR’s software and SeaSondeR export Radial Metrics in the **LLUV** format—a simple, tabular ASCII representation. An LLUV file actually consists of three sections:
1. A **header** containing global metadata (timestamps, site identifiers, processing parameters).  
2. A **main table** of individual Radial Metrics (each echo’s bearing, range, signal strength, etc.).  
3. A **secondary summary table** grouping echoes by range bins, providing aggregate statistics per distance.

While human-readable, LLUV (like CSV) is not optimized for large-scale analyses [2](#ref2), so pre-ingestion into a more efficient, read-oriented format is essential for any workflow that handles extended time series.

This repository defines the specifications of a parquet format that complies with GeoParquet v1.1.0 and a STAC catalog to store HF-Radar Radial Metrics for efficient data analysis pipelines.
